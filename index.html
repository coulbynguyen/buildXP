          <p class="homepage-rotating-text-container-text">There are countless number of people who have an amazing idea without the knowledge or capital to see their ideas developed into a finished product. On the developers end, thousands of college students are looking for projects to complete to bolster their resumes and learn real world computer science applications. BuildXP connects entrepreneurs to budding programmers with minimal upfront investment needed from the client, and low stress work for programmers to build knowledge and experience, while providing the client with the product they wanted.</p>

          <p class="homepage-rotating-text-container-text">Currently the only way for entrepreneurs to get high level programming done on their idea is to spend large amounts of money contracting programmers to develop their ideas. On the flip side, the only way for college age programmers to get experience is through internships, which most students do, but does little to separate talent once they enter the job field. Our solution opens up the world to high level programming for all sorts of development on their entrepreneurial ideas, and gives students real world projects that show companies that these students can handle the real world of programming at a high level.</p>

          <p class="homepage-rotating-text-container-text">We have a few models for revenue in place for when we go public. The first is taking a percent of equity for each project that is proposed, and completed. The second model is subscription based, where we have premium accounts (entrepreneurs) that can post as frequently as often, or (devs) that can see the projects first before others. The third revenue model we generated was partnering with companies, and having them create an apprenticeship program, which is a little internship trial through projects.</p>
